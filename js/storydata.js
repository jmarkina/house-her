The language, culture, and people were so different from my home in Ukraine. By escaping his abuse, I would be condemning myself to a world that I did not understand. Jobless, homeless, and friendless would be the words to describe me. How could I decide between these two horrible options? Thankfully, I did not have to. I was able to receive the legal advice and translating services I needed. I am now enrolled in English classes and am building the life I thought I would never achieve.",

The answer: by being myself. I knew that by coming out to my parents I was becoming an orphan. Little did I know that I would find a friend to help me along on my journey to self-discovery. My counselor at El/La Para TransLatinas helped me to accept myself for the unique and wonderful person that I am.",

Instead of meeting a bright future, I was filled with fear. I knew that if Hugh found me, he would make me pay. Every night, I stared at the hotel door waiting for his pounding fists. My shadow, once my faithful companion, made my heart race. Safe House was my rescuer. The staff and counselors helped me to feel safe again.

I laid there stripped bare of my identity and cried for the child that died that night. Little did I know of the horrors that awaited me. Of the monsters that would haunt me every night for the next four years. When I didnâ€™t think there was any hope left, I was rescued from my despair.

How could I call myself a mother and not provide for my son? All I want to do is give Jesse the world. He is the one bright spot in my life, and I would do anything to make him happy.  When I found out about W.O.M.A.N INC., I thought it was too good to be true. Through their support, I was able to provide for my Jesse.
