		<h1>Jazmine</h1>
		<p>I sat in the downpour rocking Jesse, my seven-month old son, trying to settle his crying. I was agonizing over how I was going to supply his next meal. How could I call myself a mother and not provide for my son? All I want to do is give Jesse the world. He is the one bright spot in my life, and I would do anything to make him happy.  When I found out about W.O.M.A.N INC., I thought it was too good to be true. Through their support, I was able to provide for my Jesse. The happiest moment of my life was seeing his smiling face once again.</p>
