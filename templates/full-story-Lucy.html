				<h1>Lucy</h1>
				<p>I finally did it! I left Hugh. The man who was supposed to love and protect me, but whose fists left bruises and words left scars. Instead of meeting a bright future, I was filled with fear. I knew that if Hugh found me, he would make me pay. Every night, I stared at the hotel door waiting for his pounding fists. My shadow, once my faithful companion, made my heart race. Safe House was my rescuer. The staff and counselors helped me to feel safe again. I know now that Hugh will never be able to reach me again.</p>
