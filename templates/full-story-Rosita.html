				<h1>Rosita</h1>
				<p>I was sold into sex trafficking at 13. Within seconds, my family, home, and way of life was stolen. I laid there stripped bare of my identity and cried for the child that died that night. Little did I know of the horrors that awaited me. Of the monsters that would haunt me every night for the next four years. When I didnâ€™t think there was any hope left, I was rescued from my despair. Freedom House is helping me to learn to trust again. I am discovering the strong woman that has been inside of me the whole time.</p>
